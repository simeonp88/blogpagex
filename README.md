hello just want to say

there are multiple files which you can download individually

and there is a zipped file that has the whole of the individual files and folders

its quite simple if you see a html file before for you know to click it to view it


You have the permission to do what what you want with it except claim copyright or ownership

the best way to use it is strip it for parts and use in your own project but that's all you

the images are from free website so its up to you if you can to continue to use it

the files contain

- html 
- css



that's it no frameworks or javascript


that's all by for now
